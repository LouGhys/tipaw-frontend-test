# Tipaw Pro List - Lou Ghys

This is a simple app to display the list of professions from Tipaw. When you find one you're interested in you can get more details.

This application has been created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

To complete the assessment:

1. Clone this repository and navigate to it
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run it locally: `expo start`
4. Read the [issues](./issues) description
5. Solve or implement the [issues](./issues). Preferably create branches or merge requests per issue in order to review the changes in isolation ðŸ™‚
6. Upload your solution to a personal repository (Gitlab or Github) and send us the link so we can review everything.

Feel free to remove, add or refactor any component or the project itself. Show us how you'll bring a small idea closer to production ðŸ’ª

*Bonus points if you can deploy your solution so we can view it in the browser directly.*

## GraphQL Note

This app makes use of the GraphQL for data fetching form tipaw. Please see https://api-pro.app.tipaw.com/app for API docs.

In this assessment we will only make use of the `prosGetMany` and `prosGetOne` queries.

Feel free to test your queries in the browser
