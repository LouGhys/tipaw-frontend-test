# Tipaw Pro List

This is a simple app to display the list of professions from Tipaw. When you find one you're interested in you can get more details.

This application has been created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

To complete the assessment:

1. Clone this repository and navigate to it
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run it locally: `expo start`
4. Read the [issues](./issues) description
5. Solve or implement the [issues](./issues). Preferably create branches or merge requests per issue in order to review the changes in isolation ðŸ™‚
6. Upload your solution to a personal repository (Gitlab or Github) and send us the link back.

Feel free to remove, add or refactor any component or the project itself. Show us how you'll bring a small idea closer to production ðŸ’ª

## GraphQL Note

This app makes use of the GraphQL for data fetching form tipaw. Please see https://api-pro.app.tipaw.com/app for API docs.

In this assessment we will only make use of the `prosGetMany` and `prosGetOne` queries.

Feel free to test your queries in the browser
